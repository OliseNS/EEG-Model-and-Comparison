# EEG Classification and Model Comparison

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying EEG (Electroencephalogram) data using an optimized **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. Additionally, it compares the ANNâ€™s performance with other popular machine learning models: **Decision Tree**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. The goal is to identify the most effective approach for EEG classification through rigorous evaluation and visualization.

## Features

- **Comprehensive EEG Data Preprocessing**
  - Standardization, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction steps ensure high-quality input for all models.
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Implementation**
  - Custom neural network architecture specifically designed and tuned for EEG classification tasks.
- **Comparative Machine Learning Models**
  - Evaluation of Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM models alongside the ANN to benchmark performance.
- **Robust Evaluation Metrics**
  - Includes Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix for detailed model assessment.
- **Visualization Tools**
  - Clear and informative plots to compare model performances and highlight key findings.
